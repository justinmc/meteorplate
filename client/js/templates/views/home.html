        <h2>You are running Meteorplate!</h2>
        <p>
            Use this boilerplate as a quick and solid foundation to your own projects.  The latest code is always on the <a href="https://github.com/justinmc/meteorplate">github page</a>, and feel free to post any bugs there or jump in with your own contributions.

		<h3>Some interesting parts of the project to check out:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Click the links above to try out routing with <a href="https://github.com/EventedMind/iron-router">Iron Router</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sign in to see how the project renders the navbar reactively using component views that can be rendered anywhere in your page.
            </li>
            <li>
                Notice that you can't access the <a href="/account">account page</a> while not signed in because of the project's routing based on permissions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Everything is still reactive and live-reloading!
            </li>
        </ul>
